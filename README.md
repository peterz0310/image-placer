# Image Placer

A modern web-based image composition tool for creating professional product mockups by placing and transforming overlay images onto base images. Built with Next.js 15, React 19, and Fabric.js for a smooth, responsive editing experience.

## Overview

Image Placer enables users to create professional product mockups by:

- Loading a base image (e.g., model hand, packaging template, device mockup)
- Adding multiple overlay images with precise positioning and transformations
- Creating custom vector masks for precise image shaping
- Applying blend modes and opacity controls for realistic compositing
- Tagging layers for specialized workflows (nail positions, design elements)
- Exporting complete project packages with all assets and settings preserved
- Creating portable templates that work across different image sizes

Perfect for creating nail design mockups, product packaging visualizations, screen mockups, apparel designs, and more. Specialized features for nail design apps include layer tagging for position mapping and normalized scaling for template portability.

### **Data Model**

Projects use a JSON structure with normalized coordinates (0-1 range) relative to base image dimensions, ensuring resolution independence and template portability:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "metadata": {
    "created": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "modified": "2025-01-15T11:45:00Z",
    "author": "User"
  },
  "base": {
    "name": "model-hand.png",
    "width": 1200,
    "height": 1600
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "name": "nail-design.png",
      "tag": "left_pinky",
      "transform": {
        "left": 0.5,
        "top": 0.5,
        "scaleX": 0.25,
        "scaleY": 0.25,
        "angle": 15.0,
        "skewX": 0,
        "skewY": 0,
        "normalizedScaleX": 0.15,
        "normalizedScaleY": 0.12
      },
      "mask": {
        "enabled": true,
        "visible": true,
        "path": [
          [0.45, 0.35],
          [0.55, 0.35],
          [0.55, 0.65],
          [0.45, 0.65]
        ],
        "feather": 2.0
      },
      "opacity": 0.8,
      "blendMode": "multiply",
      "visible": true,
      "locked": false
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Key Features of the Data Model:**

- **Layer Tags**: Optional `tag` field for workflow-specific layer identification
- **Dual Scaling System**: Both legacy (`scaleX`/`scaleY`) and normalized scale values for backward compatibility
- **Normalized Scaling**: `normalizedScaleX`/`normalizedScaleY` represent rendered size as fraction of base image dimensions
- **Template Portability**: Normalized values ensure consistent visual appearance across different overlay image sizes

## Getting Started
